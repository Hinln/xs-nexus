## V2 Evidence Rules

- Every new run gets an immutable UTC timestamped directory outside Git.
- Evidence records exact Git revision, command, tool version, environment, exit status, and SHA-256 manifest.
- Secret scans run before evidence is indexed or copied.
- A Markdown conclusion never substitutes for raw logs, reports, packet captures, screenshots, signed manifests, or runtime inspection.
- Failed evidence is retained and clearly marked failed.

## Pending V2 Evidence

- Gate 01 clean build, release manifest, version endpoints, container reverse verification.
- Gate 02 no-value secret inventory, rotation receipts, old-value rejection checks, deep artifact/history/layer scan.
- Gate 14 host-hardening baseline/change/rollback verification.
- Gate 16 role/grant snapshot, migration, negative permissions and redeployment.
- Gate 13 origin TLS chain, SNI, CDN mode, browser/API/WebSocket/Console E2E.
- Gates 04/06/08/09/15/18/19/20/21/22/23/24/25 current-revision regressions.
- External Gate evidence for Windows, NAS, WAN, subnet router, offsite restore, key ceremony, and independent audit.
